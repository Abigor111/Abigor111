# About Me

Hi, I’m Igor Carvalheira, also known online as @Abigor111. I'm from Portugal, so my native language is Portuguese. I also speak English, but I'm not that fluent.

# Interests

I’m passionate about Data Science and Software Development. My favorite language is Python, which I use the most. I also have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and PHP, though they are not my preferred languages.

Currently, I’m focusing on advancing my Python skills and exploring more about software development. My goal is to integrate Python with other languages to develop websites and apps, leveraging my data science knowledge.

# Main Projects

### Spiegel

The goal of this project is to create a website that displays crime data from various countries, using graphs, maps, and more.

It's still in the early stages, so there's not much to say yet — I'm still working on its structure.

# Learning Goals

R: To deepen my understanding of Data Science.

JavaScript: Despite my reservations, I recognize its power and want to learn more to build complex projects.

# Collaboration

I’m still a newbie in programming, but I’m learning every day. I believe in learning together, so if you have a not-too-complex project, I’d love to collaborate.
